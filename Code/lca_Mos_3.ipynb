      "Imagine you are 14 years old but only as tall as a pencil. You don’t have any arms. When you turn 60, your first arm grows. Another arm grows, and then another. One day you realize you have nine arms. You are now 150 years old and as tall as a three-story building.\n",
      "What if flowers grew from your head? What if your ribs were made of wood? And let’s say you were green with sharp spines. Does that seem strange to you? That’s what it would be like to be a saguaro.\n",
      "Would you care to dance?\n",
      "Can you say saguaro? Imagine that the gu is a w. Try saying it like this: suh-WAR-oh. Saguaro. suh-WAR-oh.\n",
      "A saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is a giant green cactus with a round trunk and curved arms. People often think that saguaros look like humans. Many saguaros look as though they are waving, and some appear to be dancing. But despite how they look, they all stand silently through the day and night.\n",
      "The saguaro cactus is the silent keeper of desert secrets. From above, this green giant witnesses many lives. Bees buzz by, snakes slither past, and coyotes hunt and howl under a full moon.\n",
      "What parts of history might this saguaro  have seen?\n",
      "An old saguaro has watched human history evolve. People invented cars, then televisions, and then computers. Many old saguaros have even watched the ownership of their very land change from one country to another!\n",
      "In this book, you will learn more cool things about the saguaro. You will learn where it lives and how it survives. You will also read about different animals that check into this cactus hotel. By the end, you may even imagine the taste of saguaro candy in your mouth!\n",
      "Saguaro spines grow in clusters.\n",
      "The saguaro grows only in the Sonoran Desert. It cannot be found anywhere else in the world!  Though, even in the Sonoran Desert, it cannot grow everywhere. The saguaro needs enough water to grow and protection from freezing temperatures. It usually grows on land between sea level and 4,000 feet (1,219 m) above sea level. This area provides the saguaro with the conditions it needs to grow.\n",
      "The saguaro also needs to protect itself from other desert dangers. It grows thousands of two-inch spines on its body. These sharp spines prevent animals from eating it. Spines also are the saguaro’s silent way of saying, “Don’t knock me down!”\n",
      "This bar graph shows (in feet) the slow, tall growth of the saguaro.\n",
      "A saguaro grows very slowly. At age 14, it is still a baby and only as tall as a pencil. A baby saguaro normally grows under a nursing plant like a palo verde. The nursing plant protects it from the sun, wind, and animals.\n",
      "A saguaro will not grow its first flower until the age of 50. The cactus may grow many arms and hundreds of flowers. It will grow its first branch, or arm at 60. The height of a 200-year-old saguaro may extend more than 50 feet (15 m) above the Sonoran Desert surface.\n",
      "The Sonoran Desert is located in North America. People from Mexico, the United States, and several Native American nations call the Sonoran Desert home.\n",
      "The Sonoran Desert is hot—a summer day can reach a scorching 120˚F (49˚C)! The Sonoran Desert is also dry. Months can pass without a single drop of rain.\n",
      "What if you didn’t drink a drop of water for months—wouldn’t you get thirsty? Like people and other animals, plants need water to live. Water is scarce in the desert.\n",
      "Saguaros expand like sponges when they soak up rainwater.\n",
      "But when it does rain, it rains hard. Half of the year’s rain falls in just two months. These late summer monsoon storms bring strong winds and lots of lightning. It rains so fast and hard that dry streambeds and riverbeds quickly become raging torrents of water and streets quickly flood.\n",
      "The saguaro is an expert water collector. Its long, shallow roots spread out in all directions just below the ground’s surface. When it rains, these roots soak up tons of water, which the saguaro stores inside its trunk and arms.\n",
      "Many plants lose water through their leaves. Just as people sweat, plants transpire. But the saguaro has spines instead of leaves, so it doesn’t lose as much water. The saguaro’s skin is tough and waxy. This also helps to keep water inside.\n",
      "This owl is just one of many animals that live in the Sonoran Desert.\n",
      "The word cactus has two plural forms: cactuses and cacti. Many people from the Sonoran Desert say “cacti”: One cactus, two cacti, three cacti, four . . .\n",
      "Survival in this desert is tough. Animals and plants must find enough water to live, and they must protect themselves from the extreme weather. They also must defend against hungry animals.\n",
      "Many plants and animals have adapted well to the Sonoran Desert. Humming birds, doves, and quail fly about. Coyotes, rabbits, and snakes also live here.  Many types of bushes, trees, and other cacti grow here as well.\n",
      "Gila woodpeckers make their home in this saguaro.\n",
      "The saguaro is a center of activity for many desert animals. This hospitable cactus has free rooms for birds, lizards, and insects. These rooms are cool in the summer, and they have pretty views.\n",
      "Every spring, the Gila woodpecker chisels out a new home inside a saguaro cactus. First the woodpecker makes a narrow entrance. Then it hollows out a deep room.\n",
      "Inside this room, the female lays her eggs. The nest is high above the desert floor. The saguaro’s sharp spines help to protect the baby birds. Inside the saguaro they will be safe from predators. When the woodpecker family moves out, tiny owls or other birds will move in.\n",
      "Hawks may build their nests high in the saguaro. These nests, made of twigs and grass, rest on the arms of the giant cactus.\n",
      "Bees drink nectar and help spread pollen.\n",
      "The saguaro attracts other desert animals as well. It serves up free flowers, nectar, and fruit.\n",
      "In late spring, the saguaro produces flowers that are white with yellow centers. They grow on the tips of the saguaro’s arms and trunk. A summer saguaro looks as if it is holding flowers in its hands. Around its head is a flowery crown.\n",
      "A saguaro’s flowers open for a short time at night and close during the heat of the day. When the flowers open, birds, insects, and bats drink the flowers’ sweet nectar.\n",
      "While drinking, these animals get dusted with pollen. Then they fly to the next flower and spread the pollen. This is what pollinates saguaro flowers and makes the fruit grow.\n",
      "Saguaro fruit is red with black seeds. Birds like to eat this sweet fruit. Sometimes saguaro fruit falls to the ground. Foxes, coyotes, and javelinas enjoy these sweet summer treats.\n",
      ") people have lived in the Sonoran Desert for hundreds of years. The saguaro cactus is an important part of their lives.\n",
      "In the past, they left their villages every summer and moved into cactus camps for a few weeks. These camps were located near the mighty saguaros.\n",
      "Women and children harvested the ripe fruit using the long wooden ribs of dead saguaros. Women knocked the fruit down, and children collected it in baskets.\n",
      "Back at the camp, the women would boil the fruit in water, and then they would filter it. Next, they poured the sweet syrup into clay jugs. Finally, they carried the jugs back to their villages.\n",
      "The Tohono O’odham still make saguaro jams, candies, and wine. They use the wine for a special rain ceremony.\n",
      "A palo verde tree (left) often serves as a nursing plant for saguaros.\n",
      "Every saguaro begins its life as a small seed on the ground. When the seed germinates, roots grow. The baby saguaro begins to grow under a nursing plant, and over time, the cactus grows high above the desert floor.\n",
      "Like all plants and animals, saguaros will die. They grow old, and their life ends. However, some saguaros die before old age. They may freeze on cold nights, or they may become infected with diseases. A few unfortunate saguaros get struck by lightning.\n",
      "Saguaro ribs are a shadow of the mighty saguaro that once lived.\n",
      "When a saguaro dies, its fleshy skin falls to the ground. Termites, scorpions, and lizards burrow new homes inside of it. Slowly, the body of the saguaro decomposes, and it turns back into desert soil. The saguaro’s wooden ribs often remain standing like a tribute to the cactus’s life. But after a while, these ribs also fall down.\n",
      "The mighty saguaro has come to symbolize the Sonoran Desert. It shows up on postcards, in movies, and on Arizona license plates.\n"

Some tourists like to hike on park trails and enjoy the beauty of the saguaro in their Sonoran desert home.\n",

      "Grandma and I are similar in so many ways, it’s no wonder we are so close, like two peas in a pod. We are crazy about karaoke, concerned about the environment, serious chess players, and passionate writers.\n",
      "Grandma writes a famous mystery series starring her five grandchildren—I’m the lead detective—while I prefer to write poetry. Like all passionate writers, we share a love of words that led us to the habit of taping words to our bathroom mirrors—famous quotes for Grandma and favorite words for me.\n",
      "That’s why I never felt as horrid as the day I thought I ruined everything, like a wave crashing a breathtaking sand castle.\n",
      "It was moving day, and Mom, Dad, and Grandma eagerly directed movers inside our antebellum North Carolina home. But my stomach was in a knot, and I needed air.\n",
      "Boing . . . boing . . . boing . . . . It felt good to whack the basketball against the garage door—at least that hadn’t changed from Pennsylvania to North Carolina. I tried to whack away the cloud of anxiety that had been hovering over me since I learned of the move last month—on the last day of school, actually. That’s when Dad giddily broke the news about his fabulous new job about a million miles from friends and relatives. Life as I knew it was over, wrecked, finished, ruined.\n",
      ",” Mom called from the kitchen window. “You’ll leave marks on the garage.”\n",
      "Boing . . . boing . . . boing . . . . I knew Dad despised his old job, but was it really that terrible, and was it necessary to leave the state to find a better one?! Did he even try to look for new employment in Pennsylvania?\n",
      ",” Dad called, trying his best to mimic Mom’s Spanish accent.\n",
      "Boing . . . boing . . . boing . . . . But throughout the past month, I had never seen Dad so deliriously happy—humming, talking a mile a minute, and tickling Mom. His bliss means my misery, and that is so unfair I could scream!\n",
      "Boing . . . boing . . . ”Hey, watch it!” bellowed a mover, rubbing his head where the ball struck.\n",
      "Grandma must have sensed my irritation, so she invited me to explore the trail behind our house, rescuing me from angry glares. “So how’s it going, Sam?”\n",
      "“We’ll get used to it,” said Grandma. “I do love how green and lush it is, though. Aristotle hit the nail on the head when he said, ‘In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous.’”\n",
      "“Well, there’s nothing marvelous about moving here. Do you realize I should be swimming with Kate and Jordan right now! I wonder how long it will take before they forget all about me.”\n",
      "“I know it’s difficult, Sammy, but you’ll make new friends.”\n",
      "“How?” I screamed as my blood boiled. “Everyone here already has their friends. They don’t need an outsider nosing in and screwing up their relationships.” Angry tears blurred my vision, and my heart pounded like hail on a roof.\n",
      "“Benjamin Franklin said, ‘Do not anticipate trouble, or worry about what may never happen. Keep in the sunlight.’”\n",
      "That’s when I exploded like a firecracker.\n",
      "Shut up!” I wailed. “Your stupid quotes aren’t helping!”\n",
      "The ugly words hung in the steamy air for several long moments. I dreaded looking Grandma in the eye, and when I did, her eyes, appearing both concerned and stern, spoke volumes without her having to utter the words they intended to convey: Don’t ever speak to me that way again.\n",
      "Then her mouth opened. “Samantha,” she spoke slowly and softly, “when Grandpa died, I was full of rage, and you know how I coped? I furiously wrote in my journal. Perhaps you can write poems about your feelings, and maybe that will keep your family from becoming human punching bags.”\n",
      "I watched her walk down the trail, feeling more miserable and ashamed than I ever thought possible.\n",
      "What was the matter with me?\n",
      "Grandma’s positive outlook and love of quotes are two of her most incredible qualities—they make her uniquely Grandma.\n",
      "Back at the house, I unpacked my bedroom as quick as lightning. Luckily, everyone in the house was busy all day unpacking and arranging his or her own living space, leaving me uninterrupted time to think—and to write.\n",
      "I scrawled in my journal all the crummy aspects of the move. I made lists of all the people, places, and things I’d miss—my Cuban cousins, my favorite soul food restaurant, and the secret hideaway in my old backyard where I could write in my journal undisturbed.\n",
      "I wrote a poem about my fright over not being good at making new friends. Once again, Grandma showed me her wisdom, and the anger and anxiety were safe inside my journal and almost entirely out of my head. All I wanted to do next was make up with Grandma for my horrible behavior.\n",
      "After serious brainstorming, I decided my apology would be a celebration of her, as well as her love of quotes.\n",
      "I went online using my newly hooked-up computer and a search engine to find quotes featuring grandmothers, and then I made a collage using different-colored paper, paints, stickers, and glitter.\n",
      "Before she looked at my handmade card, Grandma whirled around her room, showing me her furniture arrangement and the bird’s nest outside her window in the longleaf pine. Then she plopped on the bed and beamed as she read aloud, “‘Grandmas are moms with lots of frosting,’ author unknown; ‘A Grandmother is a little bit parent, a little bit teacher, and a little bit best friend,’ by G. W. Curtis; and ‘If nothing is going well, call your grandmother,’ an Italian proverb.”\n",
      "She hugged me tightly, told me “Apology accepted,” and then said she loved me more than caramel-covered flan. Then she whispered in my ear, “John Wayne said, ‘Courage is being scared to death—but saddling up anyway.’ So saddle up, Sammy!”\n",
      "And I did. She helped me find the strength to be brave.\n",
